            <p class="article-para" style="padding: 0 80px 0 80px"> Computational thinking is not the same thing as programming. Programming is the act of instructing a computer on the tasks it must perform and the methods by which to execute them. It's a direct communication with the machine through code, translating human logic into a language that the computer can understand and act upon. However, before you can program effectively, you need a blueprint of the problem you're trying to solve and the steps needed to address it, this is where computational thinking comes into play.The four main aspects of computational thinking are decomposition, where problems are broken down into manageable segments; pattern recognition, to identify similarities and differences that inform solutions; abstraction, focusing on relevant information while discarding the superfluous; and algorithm design, to create a step-by-step solution to the problem. (York University, 2023) With computational thinking, you can conceptualise and outline what you need to communicate to the computer, it helps you craft the 'what' and 'how' that you will later translate into programming languages. </p>

            <p class="article-para" style="padding: 0 80px 0 80px">One of the reasons computational thinking is so important is that whilst technology is always evolving, the principles of computational thinking remain constant. They provide a foundational approach to learning new programming languages, understanding machine learning models, and adapting to new computational paradigms. This systematic approach to learning and problem-solving is not just a method but a mindset that you can carry with you in all your programming projects. It would be a mistake however to assume that computational thinking is limited to computer science and programming, it has shown utlity in the fields of statistics, biology, economics and many others (Wing, 2008, p. 3719). Thus learning computational thinking not only equips programmers with a versatile problem-solving mindset in a rapidly changing tech landscape, but also trains your mind to think in a way that can help you in a diverse range of potential situations that you might encounter in your work life.</p>

            <p class="article-para" style="padding: 0 80px 0 80px">My personal career ambition is to work in programming and I believe that computational thinking will help me to tackle complex challenges and adapt to emerging technologies. I am also of the belief that computational thinking engenders an attitude that can be useful when approaching business and philantropic endevours. The best business and philantropic ideas solve a problem, and computational thinking is fundamentally about solving problems.  Of course, computational thinking is most directly applied, unsurprisingly, to the field of computing. However is not only a tool for computers, but a way to find innovative and efficient solutions to an array of multifaceted problems. I believe that by embracing the ethos of computational thinking, I am more capable of making a tangible difference in whichever sector my career path leads me.</p>
