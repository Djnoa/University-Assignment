        <p class="article-para" style="padding: 0 80px 0 80px">This module has been engaging and mentally stimulating. I feel it has been useful both in developing a deeper understanding of computer science, as well as proffering much that is potentially of much use in terms of practrical application. We focused considerably on the fundamentals of HTML & CSS, where we were taught to structure web content and apply styling to create user-friendly web pages. The early stages involved understanding the syntax and properties of both languages, progressing to more complex layouts and responsive designs. I had some experience with these mark-up languages but it was beneficial to get a thorough grounding in their principles in the broader context of computational thinking. It was also very interesting and helpful to learn some of the basics of Javascript. We didn't focus on syntax, as that was not the purpose of the module, but rather approached it in a conceptual way. For example the concept of a computational model was touched upon and I found it interesting how this relates to computational thinking. According to my understanding, models of computation are the fundamental abstracted frameworks that underpin the field of computer science. Computation itself is a series of operations carried out according to the principles of a chosen model of computation. Computational thinking, then, is the process of breaking down problems and devising solutions in such a manner that the results can be articulated through a sequence of computational actions and algorithmic procedures. I feel the fact we covered these concepts has helped me develop a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of what it means to "do" computer science. </p>

        <p class="article-para" style="padding: 0 80px 100px 80px">Just as understaning models of computation provides a scaffolding for understanding more complex programming concepts, diving into memory models, information encoding, and number systems has been essential for me to help grasp the underpinnings of computer science. Memory models dictate how programs access and manipulate memory, which is crucial for ensuring data consistency and optimizing performance. Information encoding, on the other hand, is the bedrock of data representation, determining how information is transformed into formats that can be efficiently processed by computers. This includes understanding the encoding of various data types and how they are stored and retrieved from memory. Meanwhile, number systems form the basis of all computational processes, as binary, hexadecimal, and octal systems serve as the languages computers use to perform calculations and make decisions. Understanding these concepts is not only intellectually edyfying, it facilitates the unlocking of advanced computing techniques, enabling the creation of more efficient and powerful software applications. Thus it will serve as useful for anyone aiming for a career in computer science.</p>
