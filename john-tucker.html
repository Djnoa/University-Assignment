            <p class="article-para">John Vivian Tucker is a Welsh computer scientist. Born in 1952 in our very own city, Cardiff, his father was a policeman and his mother was a homemaker (Archives of IT, 2023). He attended the Boys Grammar School in Bridgend and took A levels in physics and mathematics (pure and applied) (Ibid). The A level syllabus created by his teacher of applied mathematics at Bridgend left an impact on him. It combined computing with classical mechanics. Of this he said “So from 68 to 1970, in my applied mathematics A-Level, instead of very advanced work on static mechanics, we were learning about Boolean Algebra, circuit design, algorithms, flow charts, and mechanical calculators of the classic wind-the-handle variety …. That had quite an effect because the Boolean Algebra and the circuitry was very, very abstract and it was taught axiomatically.” (Ibid)  </p>
            <br>
            <p class="article-para">After completing his A levels he attended Warwick University, starting his degree in 1970. The onus of his degree at Warwick focused on pure mathematics, but he was able to choose subjects taught in other departments to supplement his degree (Ibid). He chose to study computing and learnt how to use an Elliot machine, an early type of computer that used punched cards using the programming language ALGOL (Ibid). After finishing his undergraduate degree at Warwick, John moved closer to his Cardiffian roots and did a postgraduate degree at Bristol in mathematical logic. He found that his deep knowledge of algebra was useful in studying the limits of what can be computed in algebraic systems, which is the subject on which he did his PhD thesis (Ibid). He later worked at several universities and institutions across the UK and Europe, including Oslo University, the Mathematical Centre in Amsterdam, Bristol University, Leeds University and Uppsala University (Ibid).  </p>

            <p class="article-para">Tucker's contributions to Computer Science during this period largely focused on computability and data types. In particular his work with Dutch computer scientist Jan Bergstra classified the specification methods for data types using both univeral algebra and recursion theory. John returned to his ancestral homeland of Wales in 1989, making the grave mistake of choosing to work at Swansea University rather than Cardiff! (Swansea University Website, 2023) At Swansea he has continued to make contributions to computability theory (Archives of IT, 2023), as well as becoming heavily involved in the research and teaching of the history of computing (Swansea University Website, 2023). In 2007 he founded the History of Computing Collection which collects, preserves and makes available media concerning the history of computing especially as it relates to Wales (Swansea University Library, 2023).  In fact, the modules that he gives lectures on at Swansea are all related to the history of computing and its influence on society (Swansea University Website, 2023). </p>
